    Image:
        What is image?
        How image is represented?
            Matrix
            (some idea about signal, set, vectors)
        RGB channels

    Steganography:
        What is steganography?
        Types of steganography?
        Spatial domain:
            LSB steganography

    Project description:
        Detection (and decoding) of LSB steganography
    Detection of steganography:
        Observations:
            Follows patterns
            Non uniform distribution
            High information entropy
